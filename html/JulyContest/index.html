            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>The <em><strong><span style="font-size: 110%">Magnetic Fields Memorial Invitational 2020 (MFMI 2020)</span></strong></em> is a Rally Championship 2000 contest that anybody can join, where the goal is to best the other participants in an A8 Championship playthrough, by acquiring the most points throughout the competition. The points are awarded after each rally, based on the rally rank. The maximum number of points achievable in a single rally depends on the number of participants. For example, the best result out of 10 competitors will be rewarded with 10 points, and with each lower rank, the amount of points decreases by 1 (so the 2nd place will get 9 points, 3rd — 8 points, and so on).</p>
            <p><u>The contest will last 18 <u>consecutive</u> days, from July 15, 2020 to August 1, 2020</u> and there will be a strict schedule. Each day, all participants will have to progress from the current service area to the next (in order to save the game). Failing to do so will result in a DNF for the rally in question. Superfluous progress will not be counted - this means that it's impossible to finish earlier than on August 1 and any attempt at doing so will be disregarded.</p>
            <h1>Validation process</h1>
            <p><u>Every participant must take two screenshots after each stage</u>: a screenshot that shows the stage time and a screenshot that shows the overall rally time (both screens can be accessed after completing a stage, just take a screenshot of them). Additionally, it's advised to <em>record</em> your runs, or at least send the replay files, so the Championship Manager (me) can ensure no rule was broken. The screenshots and the videos/replays must be sent to me no later than at 23:59 UTC+1 of each day. It's best to send them via DM on Discord, but other means are also accepted, as long as the material finds its way to me.</p>

            <h1>Closing words</h1>
            <p>I hope all of you have a great time and perform at your peak! If you have any questions, ask away in the Discord server. Good luck &amp; have fun!</p>
