            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p><em><strong><span style="font-size: 110%">New July Contest Test</span></strong></em> is a Rally Championship 2000 contest, where your goal is to conquer all 6 rallies in the BRC Championship mode, which features legendary cars from classes A5, A6 and A7, and do so the faster than your opponents. This event marks the <em>4th anniversary</em> of the modern-day RC2K community, hence the name. Fasten your seatbelts and get ready to rumble!</p>
            <p><u>The rivalry will be made as fair as possible</u> by assessing each player's skill and assigning each of them an appropriate set of cars to choose from. For example, a tenured pro will only get to pick an A5 car, while a Sunday driver will be offered a vehicle from the A7 class.</p>
            <p><u>The contest will last from January 14, 2020 to January 28, 2020</u> and there will be <u>no</u> strict schedule, ie, the championship may be completed at any point during these 2 weeks.</p>
            <h1>Validation process</h1>
            <p><u>Every participant must take two screenshots after each stage</u>: a screenshot that shows the stage time and a screenshot that shows the overall rally time (both screens can be accessed after completing a stage, just take a screenshot of them). Additionally, it's advised to <em>record</em> your runs, or at least send the replay files, so the Championship Manager (me) can ensure no rule was broken. The screenshots and the videos/replays must be sent to me no later than at 23:59 UTC+1, January 28, 2020. It's best to send them via DM on Discord, but other means are also accepted, as long as the material finds its way to me.</p>
            <h1>Rules</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>No cheats or modifications affecting the gameplay mechanics are allowed;</li>
                <li>The entire championship has to be completed <u>without any retries</u>, even if you don't finish a rally (in which case you're ranked last in the final ranking of the rally you didn't finish and you must move onto the next one);</li>
                <li>Taking any of <a href="https://rc2000.forumotion.com/t38-rally-championship-20th-anniversary-invitational-official-progress-thread#192" target="_blank">these<sup><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Icon_External_Link.svg/1200px-Icon_External_Link.svg.png" style="height: 10px;"></sup></a> shortcuts is <u>prohibited</u> and will be <em>punished</em> (i.e., please drive as cleanly as possible);</li>
                <li>You must stick to your car until the very end;</li>
                <li>UI, camera view and other game settings may be freely changed;</li>

            </ul>
            <h1>Closing words</h1>
            <p>I hope all of you have a great time and perform at your peak! If you have any questions, ask away in the Discord server. Good luck &amp; have fun!</p>
