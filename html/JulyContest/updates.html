            <div class="updateContent">
                <p>And we are off to the races! The first day is always nerve-racking and it was no different this time around! Who gave in to the nerves and who withstood the tension and emerged victorious? Let's find out!
                <br/><br/>
                Starting from the bottom, we've got its mainstay (sorry), <strong>Lewsys</strong>, closing the day with the total rally time of <u>20:57.30</u>. The Brazilian kicked off with a true banger... literally... High-octane, no-brakes, break-neck action gave us a spectacle, but sadly resulted in a poor time and sketchy service area situation right off the bat. Who knows, perhaps this is just smokescreen before the reveal of a true shocker!
                <br/><br/>
                Moving on, we have the newcomer, <strong>sBinnala</strong>, in the 8th place. His cumulative Day 1 time stands at <u>18:48.11</u>. It's a huge leap over Lewsys, but is it a satisfying debut so far? Will it get better? We'll have to wait and see.
                <br/><br/>
                Coming in at 7th, it's none other than <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong>, who on this day amassed the time of <u>17:36.15</u>. Once again, a significant advantage over his direct threat, but nonetheless only the 3rd worst result. The Peugeot 206 driver played it safe as usual, but maybe he has an offensive move in store for us later on?
                <br/><br/>
                So far we've had, let's say, uneventful happenings on the leaderboard, as everyone landed the exact same place on both stages and in the Day summary, but this time it's different! On Clocaenog Mid, Erwto bested Twajlot by roughly 8 seconds, but the two switched spots on the following SS, where the latter beat the former by slightly more than 6 seconds. Nevertheless, this means that <strong>Twajlot</strong> ultimately lost today, and with the joined time of <u>17:19.68</u>, currently occupies the 6th place, while <strong>Erwto</strong> emerges 5th, having finished the day with <u>17:17.71</u> on the clock. This is one hell of a promising rivalry!
                <br/><br/>
                There was also a battle for the podium between Migger and SpartaRemixer. Migger completed the opening stage ahead of Remixer, but the favor was returned on Penmachno South. Unfortunately for the Subaru owner, his victory was miniscule in comparison to his preceding loss. In effect, <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong> is 4th in the ranking of Day 1 with the time of <u>16:45.32</u>, and it's <strong>Migger</strong>, whose time amounts to <u>16:28.95</u>, can celebrate the lowest step of the podium!
                <br/><br/>
                Everyone knew ahead of this contest that this is the pair to watch out for. Surprise, surprise, they tore through the competition! Of course, I'm talking about the respective arch nemeses, SpartaX18 and last year's victor, Linotrix. However, the excitement is yet to sky-rocket, as today there wasn't much of a fight between the two. Without a further ado...
                <br/><br/>
                <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>The current leader of the Vauxhall Rally of Wales: <strong>SpartaX18</strong>!</em> [Time: <u>15:25.62</u>]</span>
                <br/><br/>
                His eternal foe, <strong>Linotrix</strong>, garnered the time of <u>15:54.42</u>, which isn't ideal, but the war has barely begun and we can expect a series of back-and-forth from these lads!
                <br/><br/>
                And this concludes the first day of the contest! With tons of fun and drama on the horizon, the party is about to be an absolute kicker! Stay tuned for Day 2!
                </p>

                <p>The second day of the contest is now in the rear view, as we're inching towards the end of the Vauxhall Rally of Wales. Who mastered the difficult mix of gravel and snow, and who succumbed to lacking grip? Here is the answer:
                <br/><br/>
                Rather unsurprisingly, <strong>Lewsys</strong> remains the backdoor bodyguard, closing the leaderboard on both of today's stages. His current rally time stands at <u>49:37.53</u> and a miracle will have to happen to change his fate!
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>sBinnala</strong>, on the other hand, showed a claw today and scored a decent 6th place on the snowy Hafren. Unfortunately, Myherin wasn't nearly as successful for the freshman, because he only managed to beat Lewsys and lost over a minute to the 7th place. After 4 stages, his rally time is <u>44:23.52</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                Twajlot and Erwto clashed once more and as it was the previous day, they got really close to each other! They traded adjacent ranks on today's races with minimal time differences and in the end, <strong>Erwto</strong> retained the upper hand over his main opponent, but fell down one place (we'll get to that in a bit), and currently resides in 6th with the rally time of <u>42:01.42</u>. <strong>Twajlot</strong>, on the other hand got pushed down to 7th, his time being <u>42:08.90</u> - which of course, allows for an epic attack tommorow!
                <br/><br/>
                Now what do we have over here! Speaking of epic attacks - <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong> pulled a shocker today and after quite an impressive time achieved on Hafren, he managed to jump two places at the expense of the afore-mentioned Poles! He shouldn't take this as an encouragement to relax, though, as his advantage over Erwto is just short of 10 seconds - a false start worth of time! That being said, two tracks before the end of the rally, his clock is showing <u>41:51.53</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                In a very similar fashion to the duo of Erwto and Twajlot, Migger and SpartaRemixer also continued their fierce melee on Myherin and Hafren, with Remixer prevailing on the former of the two routes, but Migger did something even better and astonishingly landed a 2nd place on Hafren!! Incredible performance, hands down! The time differences on the two stages were similar, however, which means the situation in the overall rally rankings stays as it was: <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong> and his time of <u>40:00.31</u> are the 4th best duo, while <strong>Migger's</strong> <u>39:47.25</u> secures him the 3rd spot on the table.
                <br/><br/>
                Ah shucks, here we go again. <em>The big boys</em>. Just another day in the office... at least for one of them... Why? Well, one of them dominated both SS's and the other... gave in to Migger on Hafren! Who is who? The answer will shock you! Or... not. Let me present to you:
                <br/><br/>
                <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>The current leader of the Vauxhall Rally of Wales: <strong>SpartaX18</strong>!</em> [Time: <u>37:30.84</u>]</span>
                <br/><br/>
                Yep, it was him again, who mercilessly demolished the competition! But... there is a caveat. He fell victim of a truly unfortunate accident on the 4th SS of the rally and suffered an unenviable amount of damage! This could be the perfect opening for <strong>Linotrix</strong>, who finishes the day with the overal rally time of <u>38:48.69</u>. The time loss is pretty bad... or it <em>would be</em>, under normal circumstances! It seems that the leader will have to take a massive penalty tomorrow, so anything is possible!
                <br/><br/>
                With so much going on and our stay in Wales slowly coming to an end, tomorrow is certain to provide us with immense thrill! Until then!
