            <div class="updateContent">
                <p>And we are off to the races! The first day is always nerve-racking and it was no different this time around! Who gave in to the nerves and who withstood the tension and emerged victorious? Let's find out!
                <br/><br/>
                Starting from the bottom, we've got its mainstay (sorry), <strong>Lewsys</strong>, closing the day with the total rally time of <u>20:57.30</u>. The Brazilian kicked off with a true banger... literally... High-octane, no-brakes, break-neck action gave us a spectacle, but sadly resulted in a poor time and sketchy service area situation right off the bat. Who knows, perhaps this is just smokescreen before the reveal of a true shocker!
                <br/><br/>
                Moving on, we have the newcomer, <strong>sBinnala</strong>, in the 8th place. His cumulative Day 1 time stands at <u>18:48.11</u>. It's a huge leap over Lewsys, but is it a satisfying debut so far? Will it get better? We'll have to wait and see.
                <br/><br/>
                Coming in at 7th, it's none other than <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong>, who on this day amassed the time of <u>17:36.15</u>. Once again, a significant advantage over his direct threat, but nonetheless only the 3rd worst result. The Peugeot 206 driver played it safe as usual, but maybe he has an offensive move in store for us later on?
                <br/><br/>
                So far we've had, let's say, uneventful happenings on the leaderboard, as everyone landed the exact same place on both stages and in the Day summary, but this time it's different! On Clocaenog Mid, Erwto bested Twajlot by roughly 8 seconds, but the two switched spots on the following SS, where the latter beat the former by slightly more than 6 seconds. Nevertheless, this means that <strong>Twajlot</strong> ultimately lost today, and with the joined time of <u>17:19.68</u>, currently occupies the 6th place, while <strong>Erwto</strong> emerges 5th, having finished the day with <u>17:17.71</u> on the clock. This is one hell of a promising rivalry!
                <br/><br/>
                There was also a battle for the podium between Migger and SpartaRemixer. Migger completed the opening stage ahead of Remixer, but the favor was returned on Penmachno South. Unfortunately for the Subaru owner, his victory was miniscule in comparison to his preceding loss. In effect, <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong> is 4th in the ranking of Day 1 with the time of <u>16:45.32</u>, and it's <strong>Migger</strong>, whose time amounts to <u>16:28.95</u>, can celebrate the lowest step of the podium!
                <br/><br/>
                Everyone knew ahead of this contest that this is the pair to watch out for. Surprise, surprise, they tore through the competition! Of course, I'm talking about the respective arch nemeses, SpartaX18 and last year's victor, Linotrix. However, the excitement is yet to sky-rocket, as today there wasn't much of a fight between the two. Without a further ado...
                <br/><br/>
                <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>The current leader of the Vauxhall Rally of Wales: <strong>SpartaX18</strong>!</em> [Time: <u>15:25.62</u>]</span>
                <br/><br/>
                His eternal foe, <strong>Linotrix</strong>, garnered the time of <u>15:54.42</u>, which isn't ideal, but the war has barely begun and we can expect a series of back-and-forth from these lads!
                <br/><br/>
                And this concludes the first day of the contest! With tons of fun and drama on the horizon, the party is about to be an absolute kicker! Stay tuned for Day 2!</p>
            </div>
            <button class="updateCollapsible">Day 2</button>
            <div class="updateContent">
                <p>The second day of the contest is now in the rear view, as we're inching towards the end of the Vauxhall Rally of Wales. Who mastered the difficult mix of gravel and snow, and who succumbed to lacking grip? Here is the answer:
                <br/><br/>
                Rather unsurprisingly, <strong>Lewsys</strong> remains the backdoor bodyguard, closing the leaderboard on both of today's stages. His current rally time stands at <u>49:37.53</u> and a miracle will have to happen to change his fate!
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>sBinnala</strong>, on the other hand, showed a claw today and scored a decent 6th place on the snowy Hafren. Unfortunately, Myherin wasn't nearly as successful for the freshman, because he only managed to beat Lewsys and lost over a minute to the 7th place. After 4 stages, his rally time is <u>44:23.52</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                Twajlot and Erwto clashed once more and as it was the previous day, they got really close to each other! They traded adjacent ranks on today's races with minimal time differences and in the end, <strong>Erwto</strong> retained the upper hand over his main opponent, but fell down one place (we'll get to that in a bit), and currently resides in 6th with the rally time of <u>42:01.42</u>. <strong>Twajlot</strong>, on the other hand got pushed down to 7th, his time being <u>42:08.90</u> - which of course, allows for an epic attack tommorow!
                <br/><br/>
                Now what do we have over here! Speaking of epic attacks - <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong> pulled a shocker today and after quite an impressive time achieved on Hafren, he managed to jump two places at the expense of the afore-mentioned Poles! He shouldn't take this as an encouragement to relax, though, as his advantage over Erwto is just short of 10 seconds - a false start worth of time! That being said, two tracks before the end of the rally, his clock is showing <u>41:51.53</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                In a very similar fashion to the duo of Erwto and Twajlot, Migger and SpartaRemixer also continued their fierce melee on Myherin and Hafren, with Remixer prevailing on the former of the two routes, but Migger did something even better and astonishingly landed a 2nd place on Hafren!! Incredible performance, hands down! The time differences on the two stages were similar, however, which means the situation in the overall rally rankings stays as it was: <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong> and his time of <u>40:00.31</u> are the 4th best duo, while <strong>Migger's</strong> <u>39:47.25</u> secures him the 3rd spot on the table.
                <br/><br/>
                Ah shucks, here we go again. <em>The big boys</em>. Just another day in the office... at least for one of them... Why? Well, one of them dominated both SS's and the other... gave in to Migger on Hafren! Who is who? The answer will shock you! Or... not. Let me present to you:
                <br/><br/>
                <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>The current leader of the Vauxhall Rally of Wales: <strong>SpartaX18</strong>!</em> [Time: <u>37:30.84</u>]</span>
                <br/><br/>
                Yep, it was him again, who mercilessly demolished the competition! But... there is a caveat. He fell victim to a truly unfortunate accident on the 4th SS of the rally and suffered an unenviable amount of damage! This could be the perfect opening for <strong>Linotrix</strong>, who finishes the day with the overal rally time of <u>38:48.69</u>. The time loss is pretty bad... or it <em>would be</em>, under normal circumstances! It seems that the leader will have to take a massive penalty tomorrow, so anything is possible!
                <br/><br/>
                With so much going on and our stay in Wales slowly coming to an end, tomorrow is certain to provide us with immense thrill! Until then!</p>
            </div>
            <button class="updateCollapsible">Day 3</button>
            <div class="updateContent">
                <p>Some will say these three days flew by, some will complain they dragged on like crazy, but one thing is for sure: <strong>the Vauxhall Rally of Wales is now officially behind us!</strong> But let's not get ahead of ourselves and let's take a look at the final results - and there is a <em>lot</em> to talk about, because of how bone-rattling the culmination of this rally turned out to be!
                <br/><br/>
                And we're kicking things off with something absolutely grand. Dyfi once again proved how deadly of a stage it is, taking its toll on not just one but <u>two</u> competitors! And the two unlucky fellows happened to be <strong>Lewsys</strong> and <strong>sBinnala</strong>. Interestingly, both suffered an identical fate - lights failing the inspection just before the final stage of the rally. Oh well... there is no use in crying over the spilt milk. They must accept the defeat (and <u>0 points</u>) and quickly shift their focus onto the upcoming hexathlon!
                <br/><br/>
                Moving on from the semi-literal crash site, we've got <strong>Twajlot</strong> finishing the rally 7th with the total time of <u>01:07:16.42</u> and thus earning <u>3 points</u>. Recalling his debut two years ago, it's not a result that could positively surprise, but we have to keep in mind he picked arguably the worst car out of everyone. The choice was conscious, though, so who's to blame is rather clear! It's also worth noting that despite the promising beginnings, his feud with Erwto sadly fizzled out, as he failed to overtake him on all of the final three stages.
                <br/><br/>
                Speak of the devil! After his personal best result (tied with Clocaenog Mid) so far - a 5th place - on Dyfi and a 6th on Gartheiniog, <strong>Erwto</strong> ended the rally in the already-occupied 6th spot with a final time of <u>01:06:49.53</u> - <u>4 points</u> for this chap. Regrettably for him, he had to put up with some technical issues, which may or may not have screwed him out of an additional point. Pity!
                <br/><br/>
                If you go back to the Day 1 update, you'll find a line about a certain individual starting off modestly, but being expected to pick up the speed with each kilometer covered in Wales. Lo and behold, the prediction was fulfilled on Myherin and Hafren. In the 2nd update, he was advised to keep up the good work, as complacency could bring him down. He seems to really take what's written in these updates straight to heart, because keeping his foot on the gas pedal is exactly what he did! He scored his top performance thus far on Dyfi, where he was 4th, and followed it up with a 5th on Gartheiniog, which allowed him to secure the 5th place in the rally. Less-vaguely put, <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong> picks up <u>5 points</u> for traveling across Wales in <u>01:06:27.11</u>. Neatly done!
                <br/><br/>
                It's time to reveal the outcome of another scramble between two Polish speedsters: SpartaRemixer and Migger! This one was a legitimate blinder! To recap, the Subaru driver had a 13-second lead over the Peugeot pilot after their face-off on Myherin and Hafren. Migger had another impressive run on Gartheiniog, but so did his foe - in fact, a better one, by 3 seconds! Not only that, but SpartaRemixer also reached out for the stars on Dyfi and beat the SS in the 2nd best time! Sadly, for Migger, it wasn't him who led the pack there - he placed right behind his countrymate - largely due to a fatal mistake right at the end of the stage! So to conclude, <strong>Migger</strong> lost the battle (but not the war yet!) and the effort he showed on the Welsh roads leaves him with <u>6 points</u> and the overall rally time of <u>01:03:15.77</u>. <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong> managed to complete the Vauxhall Rally of Wales in <u>01:03:03.63</u> and for that, he gets rewarded with <u>7 points</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                The final conflict may have begun a bit inconspicuously, but the plot thickened vastly after SpartaX18's major misstep yesterday. He made the decision to play the supreme gamble. Due to the terrible state of his car, he had to take a penalty, but he didn't take just any penalty. The future of the contest was what mattered to him more than a rally victory, so he opted to get rid of as much damage as possible, therefore dramatically decreasing his chances of topping the leaderboard. Linotrix, meanwhile, was in a much better position in terms of the state of his car and stuck to his slow-and-steady strategy. Because of this, he conquered Dyfi (although not by a lot - he triumphed over SpartaRemixer by merely a few seconds!), while SpartaX18 nearly scraped the bottom of the barrel thanks to the awful service area penalty. However, he struck right back on the closing stage, where he reached nearly 97% of the velocity of the current world record! And the Croat... One could say he was <em>too</em> careful there. His approach resulted in his grandest stage defeat yet - he lost by almost 45 seconds! Did that put the nail in the coffin for Linotrix, or did SpartaX18 shoot himself in the foot with the gamble at the service area? Who ultimately prevailed? Taking home <u>9 points</u> after plowing through the Welsh forests in a sexy time of <u>01:01:11.10</u> is...
                <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
                <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>THE WINNER OF THE VAUXHALL RALLY OF WALES: <strong><u>SpartaX18</u></strong>!!</em></span>
                <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
                That's right! Despite the colossal slip-up, the Polish madlad asserted his dominance in Wales! <strong>Linotrix</strong> fought hard and well, though, and his time - <u>01:01:48.92</u> - is far from something to be sad about! There is still plenty of room for comeback and there is no chance in the world this man will not take advantage of it! For now, his balance will stand at <u>8 points</u>, but the sweet "9" is a safe bet for him to pick up in the near future!
                <br/><br/>
                Phew! We are only 3 days and one rally into the contest, but the action is already through the roof! What is even better is that we can expect it to go even higher as we cover more British roads! Congratulations to the "top dogs" and see you at the mother of all rallies, the <strong>Pirelli International Rally</strong>!
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="updateCollapsible">Day 4</button>
            <div class="updateContent">
                <p>Here we are, in the treacherous and neverending forests of the Pirelli International Rally! A fresh-ish start like this was sure to pump some new energy into our veins and the all-out war will only continue to escalate. And we're starting with one of the most difficult stages in the entire championship - Chirdonhead. Who was swallowed by the darkness and who dodged the logs like a pro? Let's get right into it!
                <br/><br/>
                We have some absolutely devastating news for the start. Our debutant, <strong>sBinnala</strong> had an undisclosed accident on his way to the starting line. Here is an excerpt from the announcement made earlier today: <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/199990758089031680/419267523070918656/734137612884901971">Link</a>. We express our deepest condolences, but nevertheless are looking forward to the contest's brand new addition!
                <br/><br/>
                In much happier news, <strong>Lewsys</strong> survived today! Of course, he did not win anything... quite far from it... He achieved a time of <u>21:32.92</u>... uh... Let's focus on the positive aspect, though - he is still in the game! ...For now...
                <br/><br/>
                Moving on, <strong>Twajlot</strong> laid low again and having beaten Chirdonhead in <u>18:51.25</u> currently occupies the 7th place. When will he carry out an offensive manuever - if at all? Remains to be seen...
                <br/><br/>
                One floor above we've got <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong> with the time of <u>18:24.54</u>. Another humble start, but we know very well this guy can accelerate when the time is right. We can safely expect him not to be satisfied with this rank as far as the final rally standings are concerned!
                <br/><br/>
                Despite a rocky finish to the Vauxhall Rally of Wales, <strong>Erwto</strong> didn't lose his cool whatsoever and acquired a very decent 5th place after reaching the finish line in <u>18:09.53</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                Next we have <strong>Migger</strong>, who held onto his 4th place from the previous rally on Chirdonhead. The Pole managed to cover the SS in <u>17:57.59</u> and thus not letting his arch rival from the previous rally forget about him...
                <br/><br/>
                ...Because <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong> landed right above him in today's rankings, thanks to his slightly superior time: <u>17:49.30</u>.  These two lads are seemingly unseparable!
                <br/><br/>
                In the main event of today's show we saw... you know very well who. But it may come as a surprise, because The Champ of Wales went for a 40-second service area penalty, due to a still-unfavorable situation with his car. And what may come as an even bigger surprise... Get this, right:
                <br/><br/>
                <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>The current leader of the Pirelli International Rally: <strong>SpartaX18</strong>!</em> [Time: <u>17:24.09</u>]</span>
                <br/><br/>
                You read that correctly! He did it again! In spite of the handicap, <strong>Linotrix</strong> just couldn't quite top his nemesis. He did get very close - <u>17:32.67</u> being his result - but considering he had no such obstacles in his way, it may even come off as a bit disappointing! Nevertheless, it is what it is. Hopefully, this monopoly will end sooner rather than later - thrill is in high demand!
                <br/><br/>
                This concludes our first day of the longest rally of the entire championship. There are still plenty of kilometers ahead of us, so keep calm and don't miss any of the action!
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="updateCollapsible">Day 5</button>
            <div class="updateContent">
                <p>So here we finally are: at the day number two of Pirelli International Rally! More precisely - the long awaited day has finally arrived! The Vauxhall Rally was coming to its end, Chirdonhead was on the way... but yet you could hear the "Falstone" keyword among the rally crews these days! What is so special about Falstone? Not only the stage itself is a 'carwrecker'; it's well known for <em>The Bridge</em>, for one of the ultimate championship-ending spots if the things go wrong for the driver!
                <br/><br/>
                A fact we need to keep in mind is that Falstone is taken relatively early into the championship, so... you might wonder: Has anyone ended their championship dreams... before the championship basically even began? The mystery is solved down here!
                <br/><br/>
                At the 8th position we have: <strong>Lewsys</strong>! His Impreza (at least its bodywork) was far from perfect - but what matters the most - he made it to the finish line! What is going to happen for him on Kershope - we don't know, but what we know is that it took him <u>17:33.83</u> minutes to complete the today's objective.
                <br/><br/>
                It is <strong>Twajlot</strong> who is the first of guys faster than Lewsys. Difference between the Impreza and the Lancer Evo IV drivers was quite noticeable: the Lancer driver was faster by more than a minute! <u>16:22.41</u> was enough for him to beat Lewsys... but it was not enough for more than the 7th place.
                <br/><br/>
                Coming up next... these two inseparable guys! Of course, we are talking about Erwto and XsaraTorrada! Yes, they were placed 6th and 5th respectively, but the gap between them wasn't really negligible! Erwto's <u>16:12.63</u> and Xsara's <u>15:24.31</u> means Xsara would've waited for more than half a minute at the finish line for Erwto to arrive, so... up to you to judge! Half a minute? Sounds like much. The amount of remaining Pirelli kilometers till the end? Also sounds like much! Therefore, anything can happen!
                <br/>
                Long story short: <strong>Erwto</strong> is today's #6 and <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong> is today's #5!
                <br/><br/>
                Who was one position short of the podium? It was... <strong>Migger</strong>. This is indeed a good result for him, it's very pleasing to see him continuously bring on some good performances, subsequently showing us his Vauxhall &amp; Chirdonhead runs weren't a coincidence! A perfect time of <u>15:04.00</u> settled him just... well, below the lowest podium spot, aka spot #4.
                <br/><br/>
                So who took the podium?
                <br/>
                The aforementioned lowest podium spot, reserved for the 3rd fastest driver was taken by <strong>Linotrix</strong>. <u>14:49.37</u> means he could be happy with... the fact it was a sub-15 time, and pretty much nothing else. But podium is still a podium, right?
                <br/><br/>
                Lino had seemingly subscribed to #2 this season, but this time <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong> said 'No!'. To be more precise, if one second was equal to one 'no' - he told him 'no' <em>17 times!</em> <u>14:32.33</u> was enough to safely take the 2nd place on this year's Falstone edition.
                <br/><br/>
                And finally, something we already got used to see: it's <strong>SpartaX18</strong> who takes the winner's trophy! It took him <u>14:11.30</u> minutes to complete the Kielder forest run. Looks like there is nothing that can stop him, neither this time!
                <br/><br/>
                What you <em>really</em> wanted to know: Nope, nobody fell victim of <em>The Bridge</em> this year! Well done to everyone! About other mistakes... let's not worry about that now, right? These are going to be the drivers' worries at the Kershope service area, because nothing is the same after Falstone. It was never the same, this year <em>not</em> being an exception.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="updateCollapsible">Day 6</button>
            <div class="updateContent">
                <p>Do you ever feel like you're losing control, because time slips out of your hands before you can do anything of substance? Do you have those periods in your life, where you have to clench your fists, close your eyes and dive into the center of fate without much preparation? Regardless, this is just what Day 6 always is. With two gigantic courses behind and 3 (+ Riccarton) yet to come, a 13-minute service area is one hell of a problem. Whose time ran out and who revealed the powers of Chronos? Let's have a look!
                <br/><br/>
                17:28.35 on Kershope is only a time you can expect from one man. You have to feel sorry for the 7th <strong>Lewsys</strong>, though, as he had to endure nearly 30 kilometers with a broken engine, a worn-out turbo and an obliterated exhaust. Still, better than nothing! ...But with <u>56:35.10</u> on his Pirelli clock already, there isn't much more to hope for.
                <br/><br/>
                If we don't count sBinnala's DNF, then Kershope was the worst experience for <strong>Erwto</strong> so far in the contest, because Lewsys is the only person he managed to beat, and consequently dropped to the 7th overall rally rank (total time so far growing to <u>48:53.13</u>). There is, however, a reason behind his today's subpar time. You guessed it - the car just couldn't take it anymore, and decided to let go of one of the wheels two checkpoints before the finish line. It's easily one of the most annoying things that can happen, so Erwto might totally snap tomorrow! But will the rage be enough for him to regain the 6th position in the rally?
                <br/><br/>
                Following his best start to date, tied with two such instantces from the Vauxhall Rally of Wales - a 5th place on today's SS - <strong>Twajlot</strong> surpassed his enemy in Erwto, but <u>48:30.23</u> may not necessarily be a safe advantage over the Evo V driver, especially considering half of the rally is still ahead of us.
                <br/><br/>
                Very disappointingly (but understandably), <strong>Migger</strong> was yet another person who succumbed to the car state predicament, but unlike Erwto for example, he opted to fix the damages and get a penalty - a <em>50-second</em> one, to be specific. His Kershope time is therefore not a surprise and he has a great oppurtunity to make up for it on Pundershaw, but nevertheless, he did fall down one rank because of it and his rally time currently stands at <u>47:12.06</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                Can we officially start calling <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong> a professional climber now? He was 6th on Chirdonhead, 5th on Falstone and on Kershope - yes, 4th! His personal best, tied with Dyfi. As a result (and minding Migger's misfortune), he just achieved his highest rally rank yet: another no. 4. A good job, but <u>47:04.77</u> is not a leap away from Migger!
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>Linotrix</strong> just barely slipped below SpartaRemixer yesterday, but today the latter proved that he is a legitimate threat in Kielder and the Croat was trumped once more, this time by over 11 seconds! <u>45:18.95</u> still accounts to a great pace, but <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong>'s pace is looking even better, as his Day 6 timestamp is a fantastic <u>45:07.40</u>. Is this a sign of things to come? Can the Pole finally become the MFMI champion? Ha, it's way too early to tell... But there's no doubt he's hungrier than ever!
                <br/><br/>
                As you may have noticed, this leaves us with...
                <br/><br/>
                <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>The current leader of the Pirelli International Rally: <strong>SpartaX18</strong>!</em> [Time: <u>43:44.98</u>]</span>
                <br/><br/>
                Just another day in the office, eh? Surely, the advantage is considerable, but those who followed last year's RCXX will know that SpartaX18 isn't too keen on Pundershaw, which falls tomorrow. He's only human, after all.
                <br/><br/>
                With that being said, we're now halfway through the longest rally in the entire championship, but its longest <em>stage</em> will be tomorrow's challenge. With so much distance to cover in a single trip, it's advised to down a big coffee beforehand and buckle up tight!
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="updateCollapsible">Day 7</button>
            <div class="updateContent">
                <p>We are slowly crawling our way to the end of the Pirelli International Rally, and as we're doing so, we are forced to make sacrifices at each step. The conditions are difficult, the damage and wear becomes highly troublesome and frustration is creeping in. Thankfully, the two giants of the Kielder Forest are now finally a thing of the past and the heavenly 40-minute service area is almost within our reach. But as far as today is concerned - who got lost in the thick fog of Pundershaw and who made the 42 kilometers seem like 4.2? We shall find out right now!
                <br/><br/>
                <em>Sigh...</em> <strong>Lewsys</strong>. Demolished car. <u>01:18:07.35</u>. 8th. BUT HE'S STILL ALIVE!
                <br/><br/>
                Things are looking bleak for <strong>Erwto</strong> as well. He was 7th on Pundershaw and thus only worsened his situation. Truth be told, <u>01:06:10.75</u> is not a time that can realistically threaten sinking even lower, but he will have to scratch and claw if he wants to surpass...
                <br/><br/>
                ...The #6: <strong>Twajlot</strong>. The difference between the two on Pundershaw wasn't large, but Twajlot is on the rise and now he is almost half a minute ahead of Erwto in terms of the overall rally time, standing at <u>01:05:41.79</u>. As shown last year, the Evo IV pilot doesn't come off as a technical player, so Erwto could initiate his retribution arc on Riccarton and use the superior power of his Evo V to his advantage on Newcastleton, but these are just speculations. Reality likes to be nothing we expect it to be!
                <br/><br/>
                Revenge is sweet. How sweet? We should ask <strong>Migger</strong>, whose solid performance on Pundershaw allowed him to take back his 4th spot in the rankings at the expense of <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong>, who apparently had a worse day and lost over 50 seconds to the Polish driver on Pundershaw. His current rally time is <u>01:04:06.10</u>. Migger's - <u>01:03:22.96</u>. You do the math. Did Xsara just waste his chance for the 4th place on Pirelli? It's likely that a critical mistake from Migger is the Portuguese's only hope.
                <br/><br/>
                Today's podium shaped out quite interestingly. Just as we were getting used to SpartaX18 - SpartaRemixer - Linotrix, Pundershaw almost flipped it on its head. This time the Peugeot racer left the Poles in the dust, courtesy of his phenomenal run on the foggy giant, which was only 30 seconds slower than the world record.
                <br/>
                In any event, this is what it looks like on the rally leaderboard: <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong> failed to hold onto the silver-coated rank and his rally time stands at <u>01:00:43.95</u> and, while it's merely inferior by 10 seconds to <strong>Linotrix</strong>'s <u>01:00:33.56</u> and Remixer seems to fancy himself the penultimate stage, the latter can potentially dominate Newcastleton.
                <br/>
                In any event, still...
                <br/><br/>
                <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>The current leader of the Pirelli International Rally: <strong>SpartaX18</strong>!</em> [Time: <u>59:10.89</u>]</span>
                <br/><br/>
                Is SpartaX18's Pirelli victory in the bag, though? Not really. His vehicle isn't in the best of shapes and despite the significant lead, there is no guarantee of a back-to-back win. Nonetheless, so far so good!
                <br/><br/>
                This about concludes Day 7! The air will clear for the 2nd time tomorrow as another batch of points will be awarded to everyone (aside from sBinnala &lt;insert sad face here&gt;). See you then!
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="updateCollapsible">Day 8</button>
            <div class="updateContent">
                <p>At last, the dust has fallen on the unforgiving, endless roads of the Pirelli International Rally. The struggle was excruciatingly long and tough, but it's thankfully over. No more back-to-back 30km stages is a relief for many, especially those for whom the Kielder Forest wasn't very lucky. So, it's time to hand out some fresh points - who will hit the jackpot and who will go broke? Let's see!
                <br/><br/>
                It still hurts to say, but we cannot ignore what happened. It must be embraced that <strong>sBinnala</strong> depressingly ended his participation in the rally prematurely on the very first SS. This means he cannot be given any points. A huge blow to the debutant, but he will come back tomorrow, and... perhaps he'll come back stronger than ever!
                <br/><br/>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/o7X3LYGV_N8?t=42" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;"><em>Who's that, flying over the hill? Is it <strong>Lewsys</strong>? Is it <strong>Lewsyyys</strong>?</em></a> Why yes, it is! And despite missing half of the car and smoke &amp; fire coming from everywhere, he's launching himself straight into the 8th place in the rally, for which he gets <u>2 points</u>! An improvement over Vauxhall, to be sure, but finishing Pirelli in <u>02:01:11.85</u> is... well... it's something!! P.S.: The Brazilian stuntman has to be loudly applauded for his time on Newcastleton. It was the first time in the contest so far that he landed higher than 8th... <em>5th</em> in fact! What a shocker!
                <br/><br/>
                <u>3 points</u> is what, despite his best efforts and will, is <strong>Erwto</strong>'s takeaway from Kielder. He was in a bad way before Riccarton &amp; Newcastleton already, but matters got even worse. He set off in a ruin of a car today and that cost him a lot, especially on the shortest stage, where he placed only 7th. Newcastleton was a bit better - he even defeated his biggest foe, Twajlot, there - but far from enough to give him any better prize. <u>01:27:35.09</u> is his final Pirelli time.
                <br/><br/>
                We just mentioned him and it is that very individual, who's adding <u>4 points</u> to his account. Who's that? It's <strong>Twajlot</strong>, of course. It's been up and (mostly) down for the Pole, but to his credit, he did extremely well on Riccarton, where he was 3rd (a new personal best). The last course was unfortunately another down to add to his resume, though. Ultimately, he finished the rally in <u>01:26:59.53</u>, which is not that bad for an Evo IV run, but too little to place him higher than 6th. Nevertheless, it is actually an improvement over the Welsh rally.
                <br/>
                Very interestingly, Twajlot and Erwto are thus tied in the contest rankings at 7 points each. A duel for the ages!
                <br/><br/>
                <u>01:24:56.91</u> is almost 2 minutes less than what Twajlot achieved and it's a time that belongs to <strong>Migger</strong>. He kept up the good work on Riccarton, but dropped the ball completely at the grand finale and was the slowest there. Or, well, his car dropped the ball for him, to be honest. A myriad of technical difficulties could be said to have robbed him of the 4th place he had just fought back, but there is no turning back. <u>5 points</u> is still a decent reward, one that allows him to stay 4th on the contest leaderboard... <em>tied</em>...
                <br/><br/>
                ...With <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong>! The Peugeot driver pulled off an outrageous feat on Riccarton - he was the stage's runner-up, by far his top performance yet! And while that + a decent 4th place on Newcastleton didn't bring him any close to the rally podium, he did successfully overtake Migger with the final rally time of <u>01:24:21.62</u>, and for that, he is granted <u>6 points</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                We're now entering the top 3 and we are starting with someone, who actually stood a good chance of emerging as the runner-up of the Pirelli International Rally... until today happened. This man's time on Riccarton was only the 5th best (his worst stage rank yet!) and even though he improved on Newcastleton (#3), the loss to the no. 2 of that SS - his biggest rival, Linotrix - was a big one. This man is <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong> and he receives <u>7 points</u> for the overall rally time amounting to <u>01:21:02.62</u>. It is undoubtedly a shame he got everyone's hopes up only to end up failing miserably to land any higher, but you can't always get what you want. At least he strengthened his position in the contest ranking, so it's more likely now that he'll finish it on the podium, which is nice!
                <br/><br/>
                Do you remember SpartaX18's predicament mentioned yesterday? He was far and beyond ahead of everyone else in the rally, but a serious problem arose - in the service area, naturally. The damage shown to him before the final two tracks wasn't heart attack material per se, but it was quite sketchy. In the end, he chose to stick to his strategy and 'rather be safe than sorry'. He took yet another penalty, this time it being 1min 20s. This move put him at great risk of losing it all. If you recall, that's more or less how much ahead of Linotrix he was after Pundershaw. Everything came down to pure driving skill. Who came out victorious and who bit the dust? Without a further ado, here he is...:
                <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
                <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>THE WINNER OF THE PIRELLI INTERNATIONAL RALLY: <strong><u>SpartaX18</u></strong>!!</em></span>
                <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
                The Polish dominator obviously lost on stage #5, but if we don't count the penalty, then he was actually faster than Lino by over 14 seconds! Add to that a bonus, near-10-second advantage provided by his winning Newcastleton run and, despite the gamble, he prevailed on Pirelli with the overall time of <u>01:18:38.89</u> and another <u>9 points</u> are his reward. <strong>Linotrix</strong> still put up a good fight and <u>01:19:05.32</u> wasn't so far off, but he must accept the <u>8 points</u> for the 2nd place... for the 2nd time... <em>in the 2nd rally...</em> Can you guess what his favorite number is?!
                <br/><br/>
                Anyway, this settles the battle of the Pirelli International Rally, but the war goes on! It is time to move to Scotland, where much more action awaits. Catch y'all there!
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="updateCollapsible">Day 9</button>
            <div class="updateContent">
                <p>And so we arrived in the land up north, the fabulous country of Scotland. There may be no men in kilts or bagpipes echoing through the forests, but there is some gravel to rally on and that's all we need! On our first day here we completed a 3-in-1 stage set and we began in the dark woods of Twiglees, progressed through a beautiful sunrise in Yair and capped the day off with a sunny and full-of-life Cardrona. Who didn't make it before dinner and who feasted to celebrate a good start? Let's answer this question!
                <br/><br/>
                Agh... Another rally, another bummer. <strong>Lewsys</strong>' real life struggles woefully precluded him from even completing the first day of the rally. Lack of time and abundance of work had him pinned down and he had no other choice, but to retire. We will see him back at the SEAT Jim Clark Memorial Rally, but for now we have to say goodbye. Poor chap.
                <br/><br/>
                Since Lewsys took a DNF, you can probably easily guess who did the worst today... by a country mile. Oh yes, it is none other than <strong><s>sBinnala</s> StoneBerg</strong> (because he's substituting sBinnala, he will be referred to as sBinnala in the leaderboard). He somehow managed to almost reach the 9-minute mark on the opener with a brand new car and was the slowest on Cadrdona by a lot, too. Yair was slightly better, but nothing more than a consolation. His current rally time is <u>19:07.61</u> and off the bat it doesn't seem like he will fare well in Scotland at all...
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>Erwto</strong> had a much better start in comparison, but it wasn't great whatsoever in the grand scheme of things. He seems to have really lost his way and his efficiency has really dropped since Chirdonhead. He did just okay on Cardrona, but Twiglees was poorer and Yair - a travesty. Mechanical issues played a great part here, but it doesn't change the fact the cumulative time after the first three stages is a weak <u>17:40.01</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                Next up we have a brand new feud that has just commenced between XsaraTorrada and Migger. The former kicked off the Scottish Rally decently, with a 5th place, where he beat the latter by 10 seconds. Then, on Yair, he added another 5 seconds to his advantage, but Cardrona was a whole different story. Migger shone and placed 4th, whereas Xsara got only 7th and lost to his adversary by a bit more than 18 seconds. If you passed first grade, you'll figure out that <strong>Migger</strong> won this sparring (with the time of <u>17:08.87</u>), but <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong> creeped right behind him with his <u>17:11.97</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                The abovementioned might become a three-way soon, as <strong>Twajlot</strong> couldn't escape far from the two. He commendably landed himself two #4's and one #5 and therefore ends the day 4th in the rally rankings. As stated two sentences ago, he must remain alert however, because <u>16:53.53</u> is not a time the pair from the previous paragraph can't catch up to!
                <br/><br/>
                The top 3 today panned out... a bit boringly, quite frankly. There isn't much use in hyping it up, because the proceedings were as straight-forward as they get. We shall first talk about <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong>, who got 3rd three times in a row... in the third rally, goddammit, is number 3 <em>his</em> favorite number?! Anyway... There is actually an exciting detail about this. He decisively fought off XsaraTorrada at Pirelli and was closer to being the runner-up, but this time around it looks like he might have to do his best to maintain the bronze rank! <u>16:28.04</u> isn't necessarily alarming yet, but his advantage over Twajlot on Yair was miniscule and on Cardrona he was merely 0.95s away from falling pray to Migger!
                <br/><br/>
                A dull trifecta was accomplished by the deadly duo of SpartaX18 and Linotrix as well. They both did exceedingly well, but only one of them scored a triple crown, and it was...
                <br/><br/>
                <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>The current leader of the RSAC Scottish Rally: <strong>SpartaX18</strong>!</em> [Time: <u>15:23.44</u>]</span>
                <br/><br/>
                *Yawn*. But somewhat excitingly, he had an absolutely incredible run on Twiglees, on which he was only less than 3 seconds slower than the then-WR! <strong>Linotrix</strong>, on the other hand, didn't get close to any records, but positioned himself relatively close to the leader, his time currently standing at <u>15:46.58</u>. The remaining tracks are very troublesome due to the short service area times, which is a bad sign for SpartaX18, so it's likely that the pot will be stirred as early as tomorrow!
                <br/><br/>
                Our next stop is the infamous duet of Black Loch and Glentrool, which is preceded by an awfully short (shortest in the entire championship) service area - a hasty 11 minutes. It's about to get frantic!
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="updateCollapsible">Day 10</button>
            <div class="updateContent">
                <p>Scotland is a wonderful place. It has magical sights which take breaths away with ease. We saw them yesterday, but there is one tiny problem. It isn't all sunshine and roses. There is a gloomy, daunting side to it as well. You may start noticing it when you're strolling down Black Loch, but Glentrool is the perfect example. Everything is gray, lifeless and straight up irritating. The miniature service area preceding the two tracks only adds to the displeasure. Who submitted to the bad aura and who remained strong? Let's take a look!
                <br/><br/>
                In terms of the last place (excluding the DNF'd Lewsys)... <em>nihil novi</em>. It's still <strong><s>sBinnala</s> StoneBerg</strong>. He was defeated by everyone else on both stages and only buried himself deeper in the 8th place. Rally time: <u>41:49.97</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong>'s performance from today cannot be called anything but a sorrow disappointment. An odd pattern started back at Cardrona. Since then he's only ever come 7th, losing minimally to the 6th driver each time. This systematic auto-destruction has already taken its toll and right now he sits at <u>38:51.97</u> in the 7th rank of the rally.
                <br/><br/>
                Letdowns don't end there, however. <strong>Twajlot</strong> didn't have a particularly successful day either. He followed up his positive first day in Scotland with something much less brilliant. Two #6's in a row almost allowed the doubly 5th today <strong>Erwto</strong> to overtake him. Their RSAC times as of now stand at <u>38:28.60</u> and <u>38:32.01</u>, respectively, so Ae will be one heck of a battlefield to settle the score!
                <br/><br/>
                Conversely, <strong>Migger</strong> used his opponents' failures and crafted himself a success out of them. He finished 3rd on Black Loch and 4th on Glentrool and thanks to that jumped up one position in the rally overalls. His time after 5 out of 6 stages is a relatively safe <u>37:49.37</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                Alas, there are no surprises on the podium. <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong> casually solidified his 3rd place in the Scottish Rally with classy, but not groundbreaking runs on both of today's courses. The sum of his five latest times is <u>37:13.88</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                All the same, <strong>Linotrix</strong> added 2 more #2's to his collection, but it doesn't mean he can take the medium podium step in the entire Scottish Rally for granted. Not because it's in danger, but because in spite of all the #2's, his current rally time (<u>35:50.39</u>) doesn't make an attack at the top spot impossible. Alright, let's get this out of the way already.
                <br/><br/>
                <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>The current leader of the RSAC Scottish Rally: <strong>SpartaX18</strong>!</em> [Time: <u>35:17.31</u>]</span>
                <br/><br/>
                As you can see, the difference isn't so substantial if you take Ae's length into consideration. Moreover, the leader's car is in poor condition as always, so a cherry on top of the Scottish cake in the form of a sudden swerve is not off the table!
                <br/><br/>
                30 kilometers in rain with limited visibility on extremely narrow and hazardous roads is what awaits at the end of the RSAC Scottish Rally. Tune in tomorrow to see the product of it!

                <p>Everything eventually has to come to an end and, for the most part, we find it hard to say goodbye. Even if the journey was riddled with obstacles and drained all the energy we possessed, we often look back at it with a nostalgic sigh... but Ae is different. No one ever misses it, it's an absolute horror show impossible to remember fondly. Barely-alive cars + the overall awfulness of the track make for a fine dose of entertainment, though! It's high time we learned how well everyone ultimately fared on our trip to Scotland!
                <br/><br/>
                Of course, we must begin with <strong>Lewsys</strong>, who sadly had to stay at home due to personal business. Nonetheless, the show must go on, and so does he with <u>no points</u> being added to his tally.
                <br/><br/>
                Next on our list, scoring a <u>two-pointer</u> for his Scottish Rally participation, is none other than <strong>StoneBerg <sub>(sBinnala)</sub></strong> (rally time: <u>59:33.74</u>). Another rally, another poor result. But hey, at least he didn't retire this time, and furthermore, he even placed 5th on the final SS - his new personal best! Here's to hoping this trend continues!
                <br/><br/>
                Our following entry was the slowest on Ae and after a disastrous second day in Scotland, it proved to be the nail in the coffin for him. This man is <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong>. It's quite sad how quickly - and how low - he sank from the waves he'd surfed on at the first two rallies. Achieving a final rally time of <u>57:30.26</u> only gives him <u>3 points</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                This day was supposed to provide a thrilling contest between Twajlot and Erwto, but it turned out to be a formality. <strong>Erwto</strong> was insignificantly behind his opponent prior to Ae, but his loss was much clearer at the finale, and so, caps off the RSAC tour with <u>56:54.50</u> and <u>4 points</u>. <strong>Twajlot</strong>, on the other hand, gets <u>5 points</u> for his <u>56:25.41</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                We're on our way to the top 3, but before that, let's reveal who closed in at no. 4 with the time of <u>54:06.32</u> and is subsequently awarded <u>6 points</u>. It is... <strong>Migger</strong>! No surprises here, a strong Ae result preceded by suchlike 5 others was more than enough to increase his total score to 17.
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong> didn't stun the crowd either. He was the 3rd best on Ae, just like everywhere else in the RSAC Scottish Rally (minus Black Loch). This means that <em>for the third time...</em> You get the drill, he receives <u>7 points</u>, backed up by the rally time equal to <u>53:25.70</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                Far and away from the rest of the group we witnessed a true war for the Scottish Rally supremacy. SpartaX18 had high hopes to keep his slate clean after five straights wins, which gradually magnified his lead, but don't be fooled - in reality, the lead was never a secure one. Linotrix stayed on his tail until the very end and had no plans to let him go. A tremendous opportunity arose for the Croat due to the Pole's dire straits with his automobil. The Evo V's steering was severely damaged from the start and near the finish it started to outright refuse to steer right! This put him in the world of trouble and his confidence quickly faded. However, things didn't go down much better for his nemesis. While his vehicle didn't have any major problems, the driver himself couldn't avoid a few missteps. He landed on his roof twice, which tarnished what would've been a really great run. Spoiler alert: it was still vastly superior to SpartaX18's. But how much exactly? Was the preponderance sufficient? Here's another spoiler: the difference between the two after all six stages... - a measly <em>2.31 seconds</em>. But enough talking. Ladies and gentlemen, here he is...:
                <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
                <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>THE WINNER OF THE RSAC SCOTTISH RALLY: <strong><u>SpartaX18</u></strong>!!</em></span>
                <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
                Hat trick, hat trick!!! It's a feat nobody had ever accomplished in the illustrious 3-year history of the Magnetic Fields Memorial Invitational! But will it extend to 4-in-a-row? The gap betwen him and Lino is slowly but surely decreasing with each rally. He might have the higher ground for now, but we are only halfway, so he had better not lift his foot off the gas pedal!
                <br/>
                As for the minutia of the ruling duo's performance in the Scottish Rally, SpartaX18 pulled off a time amounting to <u>50:51.66</u>, wheras Linotrix amassed <u>50:53.97</u> and, naturally, their rewards are <u>9</u> and <u>8</u> points, accordingly.
                <br/><br/>
                In terms of the general contest table, all previously existing ties have been broken, as Migger split from XsaraTorrada and positioned himself atop the Portuguese, while Twajlot ultimately overcame Erwto, but only with a sole point of advantage. A new tie came into existence, though - sBinnala/StoneBerg caught up to Lewsys and they now stand at 2 points apiece.
                <br/><br/>
                That's it as far as our Scotland visit is concerned! As per usual, plenty of shenanigans and agitating moments. Next up is the very concise - but not to be underestimated! - SEAT Jim Clark Memorial Rally. Don't blink or you might miss it - and you might miss a lot!
