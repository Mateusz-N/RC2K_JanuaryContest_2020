            <div class="updateContent">
                <p>And we are off to the races! The first day is always nerve-racking and it was no different this time around! Who gave in to the nerves and who withstood the tension and emerged victorious? Let's find out!
                <br/><br/>
                Starting from the bottom, we've got its mainstay (sorry), <strong>Lewsys</strong>, closing the day with the total rally time of <u>20:57.30</u>. The Brazilian kicked off with a true banger... literally... High-octane, no-brakes, break-neck action gave us a spectacle, but sadly resulted in a poor time and sketchy service area situation right off the bat. Who knows, perhaps this is just smokescreen before the reveal of a true shocker!
                <br/><br/>
                Moving on, we have the newcomer, <strong>sBinnala</strong>, in the 8th place. His cumulative Day 1 time stands at <u>18:48.11</u>. It's a huge leap over Lewsys, but is it a satisfying debut so far? Will it get better? We'll have to wait and see.
                <br/><br/>
                Coming in at 7th, it's none other than <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong>, who on this day amassed the time of <u>17:36.15</u>. Once again, a significant advantage over his direct threat, but nonetheless only the 3rd worst result. The Peugeot 206 driver played it safe as usual, but maybe he has an offensive move in store for us later on?
                <br/><br/>
                So far we've had, let's say, uneventful happenings on the leaderboard, as everyone landed the exact same place on both stages and in the Day summary, but this time it's different! On Clocaenog Mid, Erwto bested Twajlot by roughly 8 seconds, but the two switched spots on the following SS, where the latter beat the former by slightly more than 6 seconds. Nevertheless, this means that <strong>Twajlot</strong> ultimately lost today, and with the joined time of <u>17:19.68</u>, currently occupies the 6th place, while <strong>Erwto</strong> emerges 5th, having finished the day with <u>17:17.71</u> on the clock. This is one hell of a promising rivalry!
                <br/><br/>
                There was also a battle for the podium between Migger and SpartaRemixer. Migger completed the opening stage ahead of Remixer, but the favor was returned on Penmachno South. Unfortunately for the Subaru owner, his victory was miniscule in comparison to his preceding loss. In effect, <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong> is 4th in the ranking of Day 1 with the time of <u>16:45.32</u>, and it's <strong>Migger</strong>, whose time amounts to <u>16:28.95</u>, can celebrate the lowest step of the podium!
                <br/><br/>
                Everyone knew ahead of this contest that this is the pair to watch out for. Surprise, surprise, they tore through the competition! Of course, I'm talking about the respective arch nemeses, SpartaX18 and last year's victor, Linotrix. However, the excitement is yet to sky-rocket, as today there wasn't much of a fight between the two. Without a further ado...
                <br/><br/>
                <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>The current leader of the Vauxhall Rally of Wales: <strong>SpartaX18</strong>!</em> [Time: <u>15:25.62</u>]</span>
                <br/><br/>
                His eternal foe, <strong>Linotrix</strong>, garnered the time of <u>15:54.42</u>, which isn't ideal, but the war has barely begun and we can expect a series of back-and-forth from these lads!
                <br/><br/>
                And this concludes the first day of the contest! With tons of fun and drama on the horizon, the party is about to be an absolute kicker! Stay tuned for Day 2!</p>
            </div>
            <button class="updateCollapsible">Day 2</button>
            <div class="updateContent">
                <p>The second day of the contest is now in the rear view, as we're inching towards the end of the Vauxhall Rally of Wales. Who mastered the difficult mix of gravel and snow, and who succumbed to lacking grip? Here is the answer:
                <br/><br/>
                Rather unsurprisingly, <strong>Lewsys</strong> remains the backdoor bodyguard, closing the leaderboard on both of today's stages. His current rally time stands at <u>49:37.53</u> and a miracle will have to happen to change his fate!
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>sBinnala</strong>, on the other hand, showed a claw today and scored a decent 6th place on the snowy Hafren. Unfortunately, Myherin wasn't nearly as successful for the freshman, because he only managed to beat Lewsys and lost over a minute to the 7th place. After 4 stages, his rally time is <u>44:23.52</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                Twajlot and Erwto clashed once more and as it was the previous day, they got really close to each other! They traded adjacent ranks on today's races with minimal time differences and in the end, <strong>Erwto</strong> retained the upper hand over his main opponent, but fell down one place (we'll get to that in a bit), and currently resides in 6th with the rally time of <u>42:01.42</u>. <strong>Twajlot</strong>, on the other hand got pushed down to 7th, his time being <u>42:08.90</u> - which of course, allows for an epic attack tommorow!
                <br/><br/>
                Now what do we have over here! Speaking of epic attacks - <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong> pulled a shocker today and after quite an impressive time achieved on Hafren, he managed to jump two places at the expense of the afore-mentioned Poles! He shouldn't take this as an encouragement to relax, though, as his advantage over Erwto is just short of 10 seconds - a false start worth of time! That being said, two tracks before the end of the rally, his clock is showing <u>41:51.53</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                In a very similar fashion to the duo of Erwto and Twajlot, Migger and SpartaRemixer also continued their fierce melee on Myherin and Hafren, with Remixer prevailing on the former of the two routes, but Migger did something even better and astonishingly landed a 2nd place on Hafren!! Incredible performance, hands down! The time differences on the two stages were similar, however, which means the situation in the overall rally rankings stays as it was: <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong> and his time of <u>40:00.31</u> are the 4th best duo, while <strong>Migger's</strong> <u>39:47.25</u> secures him the 3rd spot on the table.
                <br/><br/>
                Ah shucks, here we go again. <em>The big boys</em>. Just another day in the office... at least for one of them... Why? Well, one of them dominated both SS's and the other... gave in to Migger on Hafren! Who is who? The answer will shock you! Or... not. Let me present to you:
                <br/><br/>
                <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>The current leader of the Vauxhall Rally of Wales: <strong>SpartaX18</strong>!</em> [Time: <u>37:30.84</u>]</span>
                <br/><br/>
                Yep, it was him again, who mercilessly demolished the competition! But... there is a caveat. He fell victim to a truly unfortunate accident on the 4th SS of the rally and suffered an unenviable amount of damage! This could be the perfect opening for <strong>Linotrix</strong>, who finishes the day with the overal rally time of <u>38:48.69</u>. The time loss is pretty bad... or it <em>would be</em>, under normal circumstances! It seems that the leader will have to take a massive penalty tomorrow, so anything is possible!
                <br/><br/>
                With so much going on and our stay in Wales slowly coming to an end, tomorrow is certain to provide us with immense thrill! Until then!</p>
            </div>
            <button class="updateCollapsible">Day 3</button>
            <div class="updateContent">
                <p>Some will say these three days flew by, some will complain they dragged on like crazy, but one thing is for sure: <strong>the Vauxhall Rally of Wales is now officially behind us!</strong> But let's not get ahead of ourselves and let's take a look at the final results - and there is a <em>lot</em> to talk about, because of how bone-rattling the culmination of this rally turned out to be!
                <br/><br/>
                And we're kicking things off with something absolutely grand. Dyfi once again proved how deadly of a stage it is, taking its toll on not just one but <u>two</u> competitors! And the two unlucky fellows happened to be <strong>Lewsys</strong> and <strong>sBinnala</strong>. Interestingly, both suffered an identical fate - lights failing the inspection just before the final stage of the rally. Oh well... there is no use in crying over the spilt milk. They must accept the defeat (and <u>0 points</u>) and quickly shift their focus onto the upcoming hexathlon!
                <br/><br/>
                Moving on from the semi-literal crash site, we've got <strong>Twajlot</strong> finishing the rally 7th with the total time of <u>01:07:16.42</u> and thus earning <u>3 points</u>. Recalling his debut two years ago, it's not a result that could positively surprise, but we have to keep in mind he picked arguably the worst car out of everyone. The choice was conscious, though, so who's to blame is rather clear! It's also worth noting that despite the promising beginnings, his feud with Erwto sadly fizzled out, as he failed to overtake him on all of the final three stages.
                <br/><br/>
                Speak of the devil! After his personal best result (tied with Clocaenog Mid) so far - a 5th place - on Dyfi and a 6th on Gartheiniog, <strong>Erwto</strong> ended the rally in the already-occupied 6th spot with a final time of <u>01:06:49.53</u> - <u>4 points</u> for this chap. Regrettably for him, he had to put up with some technical issues, which may or may not have screwed him out of an additional point. Pity!
                <br/><br/>
                If you go back to the Day 1 update, you'll find a line about a certain individual starting off modestly, but being expected to pick up the speed with each kilometer covered in Wales. Lo and behold, the prediction was fulfilled on Myherin and Hafren. In the 2nd update, he was advised to keep up the good work, as complacency could bring him down. He seems to really take what's written in these updates straight to heart, because keeping his foot on the gas pedal is exactly what he did! He scored his top performance thus far on Dyfi, where he was 4th, and followed it up with a 5th on Gartheiniog, which allowed him to secure the 5th place in the rally. Less-vaguely put, <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong> picks up <u>5 points</u> for traveling across Wales in <u>01:06:27.11</u>. Neatly done!
                <br/><br/>
                It's time to reveal the outcome of another scramble between two Polish speedsters: SpartaRemixer and Migger! This one was a legitimate blinder! To recap, the Subaru driver had a 13-second lead over the Peugeot pilot after their face-off on Myherin and Hafren. Migger had another impressive run on Gartheiniog, but so did his foe - in fact, a better one, by 3 seconds! Not only that, but SpartaRemixer also reached out for the stars on Dyfi and beat the SS in the 2nd best time! Sadly, for Migger, it wasn't him who led the pack there - he placed right behind his countrymate - largely due to a fatal mistake right at the end of the stage! So to conclude, <strong>Migger</strong> lost the battle (but not the war yet!) and the effort he showed on the Welsh roads leaves him with <u>6 points</u> and the overall rally time of <u>01:03:15.77</u>. <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong> managed to complete the Vauxhall Rally of Wales in <u>01:03:03.63</u> and for that, he gets rewarded with <u>7 points</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                The final conflict may have begun a bit inconspicuously, but the plot thickened vastly after SpartaX18's major misstep yesterday. He made the decision to play the supreme gamble. Due to the terrible state of his car, he had to take a penalty, but he didn't take just any penalty. The future of the contest was what mattered to him more than a rally victory, so he opted to get rid of as much damage as possible, therefore dramatically decreasing his chances of topping the leaderboard. Linotrix, meanwhile, was in a much better position in terms of the state of his car and stuck to his slow-and-steady strategy. Because of this, he conquered Dyfi (although not by a lot - he triumphed over SpartaRemixer by merely a few seconds!), while SpartaX18 nearly scraped the bottom of the barrel thanks to the awful service area penalty. However, he struck right back on the closing stage, where he reached nearly 97% of the velocity of the current world record! And the Croat... One could say he was <em>too</em> careful there. His approach resulted in his grandest stage defeat yet - he lost by almost 45 seconds! Did that put the nail in the coffin for Linotrix, or did SpartaX18 shoot himself in the foot with the gamble at the service area? Who ultimately prevailed? Taking home <u>9 points</u> after plowing through the Welsh forests in a sexy time of <u>01:01:11.10</u> is...
                <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
                <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>THE WINNER OF THE VAUXHALL RALLY OF WALES: <strong><u>SpartaX18</u></strong>!!</em></span>
                <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
                That's right! Despite the colossal slip-up, the Polish madlad asserted his dominance in Wales! <strong>Linotrix</strong> fought hard and well, though, and his time - <u>01:01:38.92</u> - is far from something to be sad about! There is still plenty of room for comeback and there is no chance in the world this man will not take advantage of it! For now, his balance will stand at <u>8 points</u>, but the sweet "9" is a safe bet for him to pick up in the near future!
                <br/><br/>
                Phew! We are only 3 days and one rally into the contest, but the action is already through the roof! What is even better is that we can expect it to go even higher as we cover more British roads! Congratulations to the "top dogs" and see you at the mother of all rallies, the <strong>Pirelli International Rally</strong>!
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="updateCollapsible">Day 4</button>
            <div class="updateContent">
                <p>Here we are, in the treacherous and neverending forests of the Pirelli International Rally! A fresh-ish start like this was sure to pump some new energy into our veins and the all-out war will only continue to escalate. And we're starting with one of the most difficult stages in the entire championship - Chirdonhead. Who was swallowed by the darkness and who dodged the logs like a pro? Let's get right into it!
                <br/><br/>
                We have some absolutely devastating news for the start. Our debutant, <strong>sBinnala</strong> had an undisclosed accident on his way to the starting line. Here is an excerpt from the announcement made earlier today: <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/199990758089031680/419267523070918656/734137612884901971">Link</a>. We express our deepest condolences, but nevertheless are looking forward to the contest's brand new addition!
                <br/><br/>
                In much happier news, <strong>Lewsys</strong> survived today! Of course, he did not win anything... quite far from it... He achieved a time of <u>21:32.92</u>... uh... Let's focus on the positive aspect, though - he is still in the game! ...For now...
                <br/><br/>
                Moving on, <strong>Twajlot</strong> laid low again and having beaten Chirdonhead in <u>18:51.25</u> currently occupies the 7th place. When will he carry out an offensive manuever - if at all? Remains to be seen...
                <br/><br/>
                One floor above we've got <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong> with the time of <u>18:24.54</u>. Another humble start, but we know very well this guy can accelerate when the time is right. We can safely expect him not to be satisfied with this rank as far as the final rally standings are concerned!
                <br/><br/>
                Despite a rocky finish to the Vauxhall Rally of Wales, <strong>Erwto</strong> didn't lose his cool whatsoever and acquired a very decent 5th place after reaching the finish line in <u>18:09.53</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                Next we have <strong>Migger</strong>, who held onto his 4th place from the previous rally on Chirdonhead. The Pole managed to cover the SS in <u>17:57.59</u> and thus not letting his arch rival from the previous rally forget about him...
                <br/><br/>
                ...Because <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong> landed right above him in today's rankings, thanks to his slightly superior time: <u>17:49.30</u>.  These two lads are seemingly unseparable!
                <br/><br/>
                In the main event of today's show we saw... you know very well who. But it may come as a surprise, because The Champ of Wales went for a 40-second service area penalty, due to a still-unfavorable situation with his car. And what may come as an even bigger surprise... Get this, right:
                <br/><br/>
                <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>The current leader of the Pirelli International Rally: <strong>SpartaX18</strong>!</em> [Time: <u>17:24.09</u>]</span>
                <br/><br/>
                You read that correctly! He did it again! In spite of the handicap, <strong>Linotrix</strong> just couldn't quite top his nemesis. He did get very close - <u>17:32.67</u> being his result - but considering he had no such obstacles in his way, it may even come off as a bit disappointing! Nevertheless, it is what it is. Hopefully, this monopoly will end sooner rather than later - thrill is in high demand!
                <br/><br/>
                This concludes our first day of the longest rally of the entire championship. There are still plenty of kilometers ahead of us, so keep calm and don't miss any of the action!
                </p>
            </div>
            <button class="updateCollapsible">Day 5</button>
            <div class="updateContent">
                <p>So here we finally are: at the day number two of Pirelli International Rally! More precisely - the long awaited day has finally arrived! The Vauxhall Rally was coming to its end, Chirdonhead was on the way... but yet you could hear the "Falstone" keyword among the rally crews these days! What is so special about Falstone? Not only the stage itself is a 'carwrecker'; it's well known for <em>The Bridge</em>, for one of the ultimate championship-ending spots if the things go wrong for the driver!
                <br/><br/>
                A fact we need to keep in mind is that Falstone is taken relatively early into the championship, so... you might wonder: Has anyone ended their championship dreams... before the championship basically even began? The mystery is solved down here!
                <br/><br/>
                At the 8th position we have: <strong>Lewsys</strong>! His Impreza (at least its bodywork) was far from perfect - but what matters the most - he made it to the finish line! What is going to happen for him on Kershope - we don't know, but what we know is that it took him <u>17:33.83</u> minutes to complete the today's objective.
                <br/><br/>
                It is <strong>Twajlot</strong> who is the first of guys faster than Lewsys. Difference between the Impreza and the Lancer Evo IV drivers was quite noticeable: the Lancer driver was faster by more than a minute! <u>16:22.41</u> was enough for him to beat Lewsys... but it was not enough for more than the 7th place.
                <br/><br/>
                Coming up next... these two inseparable guys! Of course, we are talking about Erwto and XsaraTorrada! Yes, they were placed 6th and 5th respectively, but the gap between them wasn't really negligible! Erwto's <u>16:12.63</u> and Xsara's <u>15:24.31</u> means Xsara would've waited for more than half a minute at the finish line for Erwto to arrive, so... up to you to judge! Half a minute? Sounds like much. The amount of remaining Pirelli kilometers till the end? Also sounds like much! Therefore, anything can happen!
                <br/>
                Long story short: <strong>Erwto</strong> is today's #6 and <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong> is today's #5!

                Who was one position short of the podium? It was... <strong>Migger</strong>. This is indeed a good result for him, it's very pleasing to see him continuously bring on some good performances, subsequently showing us his Vauxhall &amp; Chirdonhead runs weren't a coincidence! A perfect time of <u>15:04.00</u> settled him just... well, below the lowest podium spot, aka spot #4.
                <br/><br/>
                So who took the podium?
                <br/>
                The aforementioned lowest podium spot, reserved for the 3rd fastest driver was taken by <strong>Linotrix</strong>. <u>14:49.37</u> means he could be happy with... the fact it was a sub-15 time, and pretty much nothing else. But podium is still a podium, right?
                <br/><br/>
                Lino had seemingly subscribed to #2 this season, but this time <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong> said 'No!'. To be more precise, if one second was equal to one 'no' - he told him 'no' <em>17 times!</em> <u>14:32.33</u> was enough to safely take the 2nd place on this year's Falstone edition.
                <br/><br/>
                And finally, something we already got used to see: it's <strong>SpartaX18</strong> who takes the winner's trophy! It took him <u>14:11.30</u> minutes to complete the Kielder forest run. Looks like there is nothing that can stop him, neither this time!
                <br/><br/>
                What you <em>really</em> wanted to know: Nope, nobody fell victim of <em>The Bridge</em> this year! Well done to everyone! About other mistakes... let's not worry about that now, right? These are going to be the drivers' worries at the Kershope service area, because nothing is the same after Falstone. It was never the same, this year <em>not</em> being an exception.</p>

            <button class="updateCollapsible">Day 6</button>
            <div class="updateContent">
                <p>Do you ever feel like you're losing control, because time slips out of your hands before you can do anything of substance? Do you have those periods in your life, where you have to clench your fists, close your eyes and dive into the center of fate without much preparation? Regardless, this is just what Day 6 always is. With two gigantic courses behind and 3 (+ Riccarton) yet to come, a 13-minute service area is one hell of a problem. Whose time ran out and who revealed the powers of Chronos? Let's have a look!
                <br/><br/>
                17:28.35 on Kershope is only a time you can expect from one man. You have to feel sorry for the 7th <strong>Lewsys</strong>, though, as he had to endure nearly 30 kilometers with a broken engine, a worn-out turbo and an obliterated exhaust. Still, better than nothing! ...But with <u>56:35.10</u> on his Pirelli clock already, there isn't much more to hope for.
                <br/><br/>
                If we don't count sBinnala's DNF, then Kershope was the worst experience for <strong>Erwto</strong> so far in the contest, because Lewsys is the only person he managed to beat, and consequently dropped to the 7th overall rally rank (total time so far growing to <u>48:53.13</u>). There is, however, a reason behind his today's subpar time. You guessed it - the car just couldn't take it anymore and decided to let go of one of the wheels two checkpoint before the finish line. It's easily one of the most annoying things that can happen, so Erwto might totally snap tomorrow! But will the rage be enough for him to regain the 6th position in the rally?
                <br/><br/>
                Following his best start to date, tied with two such instantces from the Vauxhall Rally of Wales - a 5th place on today's SS - <strong>Twajlot</strong> surpassed his enemy in Erwto, but <u>48:30.23</u> may not necessarily be a safe advantage over the Evo V driver, especially considering most of the rally is still ahead of us.
                <br/><br/>
                Very disappointingly (but understandably), <strong>Migger</strong> was yet another person who succumbed to the car state predicament, but unlike Erwto for example, he opted to fix the damages and get a penalty - a <em>50-second</em> one, to be specific. His Kershope time is therefore not a surprise and he has a great oppurtunity to make up for it on Pundershaw, but nevertheless, he did fall down one rank because of it and his rally time currently stands at <u>47:12.06</u>.
                <br/><br/>
                Can we officially start calling <strong>XsaraTorrada</strong> a professional climber now? He was 6th on Chirdonhead, 5th on Falstone and on Kershope - yes, 4th! His personal best, tied with Dyfi. As a result (and minding Migger's misfortune), he just achieved his highest rally rank yet: another no. 4. A good job, but <u>47:04.77</u> is not a leap away from Migger!
                <br/><br/>
                <strong>Linotrix</strong> just barely slipped below SpartaRemixer yesterday, but today the latter proved that he is a legitimate threat in Kielder and the Croat was trumped once more, this time by over 11 seconds! <u>45:18.95</u> still accounts to a great pace, but <strong>SpartaRemixer</strong>'s pace is looking even better, as his Day 6 timestamp is a fantastic <u>45:07.40</u>. Is this a sign of things to come? Can the Pole finally become the MFMI champion? Ha, it's way too early to tell... But there's no doubt he's hungrier than ever!
                <br/><br/>
                As you may have noticed, this leaves us with...
                <br/><br/>
                <span style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><em>The current leader of the Pirelli International Rally: <strong>SpartaX18</strong>!</em> [Time: <u>43:44.98</u>]</span>
                <br/><br/>
                Just another day in the office, eh? Surely, the advantage is considerable, but those who followed last year's RCXX will know that SpartaX18 isn't too keen on Pundershaw, which falls tomorrow. He's only human, after all.
                <br/><br/>
                With that being said, we're now halfway through the longest rally in the entire championship, but its longest <em>stage</em> will be tomorrow's challenge. With so much distance to cover in a single trip, it's advised to down a big coffee beforehand and buckle up tight!
